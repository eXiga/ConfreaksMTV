Contribution

Feel free to create new features or fix issues and notify me with a pull-request.
But before creating pull-request, please, make sure that you've covered your code with tests and old tests are still passing.
You can run tests from XCode with Command-U, but I prefer to run tests with a terminal:

```
rake
```

Yep, default rake task is test task.
