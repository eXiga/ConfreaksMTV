However, for some applications, running on shared or general-purpose virtualized hardware may be suboptimal or even unacceptable for a number of reasons, including performance or security. Workloads that can benefit from dedicated, physical systems include extremely I/O intensive and/or CPU intensive applications (analytics, 3D modeling, media transcoding, HPC, etc) or applications designed to leverage specialized hardware such as GPUs. Moreover, many applications have 'hybrid' nature, comprising different components with different infrastructure requirements, that can be best met with different kinds of hardware -- virtualized or bare-metal.\r\nIn this talk we will survey the main challenges in hosting 'bare-metal' and 'hybrid' applications in the cloud in general, and using OpenStack in particular, will outline possible design approaches, and will demonstrate how OpenStack can be enhanced to optimally host such applications.","post_date":"2014-05-21T06:00:00.000Z","announce_date":null,"host":"youtube","embed_code":"8SsuxkYSAbs","views":561,"views_last_7":0,"views_last_30":3,"license":"cc-by-sa-3.0","attribution":null,"presenters":[{"first_name":"Alex","last_name":"Glikson","aka_name":null,"twitter_handle":null},{"first_name":"Ezra","last_name":"Silvera","aka_name":null,"twitter_handle":null}]},{"id":3440,"title":"Building Database Applications with Database/SQL","image":"http://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/confreaks-tv3/production/videos/images/000/003/440/GopherCon_2014_Building_Database_Applications_with_Database_SQL_by_Baron_Schwartz_-_YouTube-original.png?1422369006","slug":"gophercon2014-building-database-applications-with-database-sql","recorded_at":"2014-04-25T20:00:00.000Z","event":"GopherCon 2014","rating":"Everyone","abstract":"I will show how to use Go's database/sql package, with MySQL as an example.

In our case, we want to bring the benefits of OpenStack to the enterprise. This means working with platforms and technologies that are already in place within the enterprise. For VMware, this means ensuring that existing VMware customers can benefit from OpenStack and Cinder without making wholesale changes to their existing storage architecture. For vSphere, we do this through the datastore construct. Until now, the native vSphere datastore has not been available to Cinder Volume consumers directly. In this session, we will discuss the new VMware VMDK Cinder Driver and how it will allow existing VMware customers to simply add Cinder to their internal clouds. Please join us for an in-depth review of the driver, the code that we are submitting to the community, a demo of the prototype and our goals for making VMware vSphere work seamlessly in an OpenStack environment.

But, what happens after you've built your \"Polls\" application? Finding the next step can be difficult. It's hard to go from \"Polls\" to \"Instagram\" and still stay motivated and excited about your Django journey.\r\n\r\nThis talk discusses public data as a good next step. Public data covers every topic imaginable, is readily available (you can even make the government send it to you), and having a ready made dataset lets you focus on exploring certain parts of Django (templates, views, url routing, models and the ORM API) while leaving other parts for later.\r\n\r\nIn the tradition of the Lawrence Journal-World, many journalist/developers have built Django applications driven by public data. We'll take a look at some of these for inspiration and look at places to get public data. We'll see that one of the neatest things about using public data is that you can build some really cool and useful applications which will help you stay motivated when the Djangoing gets tough.\r\n\r\nWe'll also walk through a live example of an application built for the San Antonio Express-News that uses the city of San Antonio's restaurant inspections. We'll see that the models and views for this application are a good next step--not too hard, but still challenging--as you continue learning the Django data management pipeline.","post_date":"2015-09-24T09:30:00.000Z","announce_date":null,"host":"youtube","embed_code":"tagYBumWBjA","views":134,"views_last_7":0,"views_last_30":0,"license":"cc-by-sa-3.0","attribution":"","presenters":[{"first_name":"Joe","last_name":"Kokenge ","aka_name":"","twitter_handle":"josephkokenge"}]},{"id":2650,"title":"From Junior Engineer to Productive Engineer, A follow up conversation","image":"http://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/confreaks-tv3/production/videos/images/000/002/650/__Rocky_Mountain_Ruby_2013_From_Junior_Engineer_to_Productive_Engineer_by_Jason_Noble_-_YouTube-original.png?1422326501","slug":"rmr2013-from-junior-engineer-to-productive-engineer-a-follow-up-conversation","recorded_at":"2013-09-27T15:40:00.000Z","event":"Rocky Mountain Ruby 2013","rating":"Everyone","abstract":"At Rocky Mountain Ruby 2012, Mike Gehard hosted a Growing Developers Panel which discussed how senior engineers, companies and code schools can help alleviate the shortage of quality software developers.\r\n\r\nTwo to three months before the conference, Comverge had one Junior engineer on staff, but no formal training/mentorship program.
